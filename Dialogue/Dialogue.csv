	Alteration	Spells of Alteration change the world around the caster so normal physical truths no longer hold.|Alteration concerns itself with magicka's ability to change, often radically, the structure and composition of any object. Unlike the school of Illusion, Alteration deals with actual change, not the appearance of it.|Slowfalling and Shield are two classic spells of the school of Alteration.|It is easy to confuse Illusion and Alteration. Both schools of magic attempt to create what is not there. The difference is in the rules of nature. Illusion is not bound by them, while Alteration is. This may seem to indicate that Alteration is the weaker of the two, but this is not true. Alteration creates a reality that is recognized by everyone. Illusion's reality is only in the mind of the caster and the target.		Faction Guild Group	==	10	NPC NoLore	==	2

	Mysticism	The art of Mysticism allows a mage to alter the nature of magic itself and involves the manipulation of magical forces and boundaries to bypass the structures and limitations of the physical world.|The school of Mysticism experiments with the most arcane aspects of magicka. Its practitioners have expanded arcane “accidents" into a useful if eclectic range of spells.|Because the forces being manipulated by Mysticism are dangerous and unknown, the spell effects are purposefully specific. This is evident in spells like Far Silence and Soul Trap.		Faction Guild Group	==	10	NPC NoLore	==	2			
	Restoration	Restoration spells heal, restore, and fortify the body's attributes and abilities, cure disease, and protect it from other malign influences.|The primary spells of the school of Restoration heal wounds, cure disease, and restore lost vitality. They can also augment strength, endurance, intelligence, agility, and other bodily attributes.|The school of Restoration is devoted to the salubrious and soothing powers of magicka, evident in spells like Cure Poison and Troll's Blood.
